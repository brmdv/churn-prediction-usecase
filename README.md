# Churn prediction for retail data

In this group project we do basic churn prediction for an unnamed company in the fashion industry, working together with [Delaware](https://www.delaware.pro/). 

It is a **learning challenge**, held over **two weeks**. Our group consisted of [brmdv](https://github.com/brmdv), [medokhodeery](https://github.com/medokhodeery/medokhodeery), [danielmendoza4213 ](https://github.com/danielmendoza4213).
